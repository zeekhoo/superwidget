#If you run this project locally, leave the value as-is.
#Optionally, you can deploy this project on a server rather than run it locally.
#Then, with your test server, you may also rewrite traffic to https.
#If you do so, you must overrite the redirect_uri parameter, so that traffic is consistently https.
#For example: https://agee.ritw.com:8043/oauth2/callback

#Then, in Okta, set the value of "Initiate login URI" = "http://localhost:8000/login-disco"
